### 5 Rules of Scope in JavaScript

There are 5 important rules to remember with regards to scope in JavaScript

1. Give your functions precise verb/action based names
2. Use camelCasedNames similar to this one
3. Properly indent function/loops/conditional code
4. Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect.  Break out your code into smaller pieces if thew function is doing more than two tasks.
    * One single task could be to compute and return a value
    * Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as printing a message to the console.
5. Data needed by Functions should be passed in as parameters/arguments instead of being accessed directly.
